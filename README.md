<b>Background</b><br/>
Based on the recommendation from https://daveceddia.com/react-practice-projects/, the purpose of this app is to practice
building web application in React, component by component. 

<b>Timeframe</b><br />
Timeframe for each small practice project should be less than a week or so.

<b>Techs</b><br />
The technologies used in this include 1) React, 2) ParcelJS and 3) MaterialUI.

<b>API</b><br />
To shorten the build speed, I used the placeholder API, <a href='https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/'>JSON Placeholder</a> to fetch from.
