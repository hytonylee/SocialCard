        title: 'Lord of the Flies',
        author: 'William Golding',
        desc: 'Golding’s compelling story about a group of very ordinary boys marooned on a coral island is a classic. At first it seems as though it is all going to be great fun; but the fun soon becomes serious and life on the island turns into a nightmare of panic and death. As ordinary standards of behavior collapse, the whole world the boys know collapses with them — the world of cricket and homework and adventure stories — and another world is revealed beneath, primitive and terrible. Published in 1954, the novel has labeled a parable, an allegory, a myth, a morality tale, a parody, a political treatise, even a vision of the apocalypse.'
